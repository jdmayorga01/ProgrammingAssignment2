## The following functions would help speed up some computational operations,
## in this case calculating the inverse of a matrix. Instead of computing it
## repeatedly, we would catch the inverse of the matrix if we need it latter on.
## The functions that would create a special object that would store the matrix 
## and catches it inverse.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
